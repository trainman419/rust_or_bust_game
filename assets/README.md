# Assets and organization

Assets are broken into backgrounds (static backgrounds for levels), characters and objects.

Backgrounds are stored in the backgrounds folder, and will probably be single images.

Objects and characters will probably have many views, states or animations, so each character and object will have its own subdirectory.
